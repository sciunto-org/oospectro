Introduction
============


This library is designed to analyze a spectrum to get a thickness. The principle of the measurement is to collect white light from a thin film of a known refractive index, and decompose the light.
Thus, we have an intensity as a function of the wavelength, for which the min and max are related to destructive and constructive interferences.




Originally, this script was developed for spectra from ocean optics products, but various sort of devices can be used.
For data acquisition of Ocean Optics spectrometers, you can use `seabreeze <https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze>`__.
